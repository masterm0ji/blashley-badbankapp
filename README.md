This is a project that uses javascript, html and css.
The purpose of this project is to create a bank that does not secure your data, in fact it openly exposes it to the world!
The project was created with node.js and though it is simple took hours of work. The code itself is far from perfect and I hope in the furture I could fix 
the bugs I struggled with and learn good practices of secure code. I would also like to do more experimenting with deploying api backends. Because after upwards of 27 hours 
trying to figure it out, I decided that it will have to be a project for another time.
